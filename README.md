# Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of classic sorting algorithms and the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python. It is intended to serve as a reference for anyone looking to understand or implement these algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is implemented in a clear, concise manner with comments to help with understanding.

## Algorithms Included
The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Bucket Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

## Getting Started
To run any of the Python scripts, simply clone the repository and execute the desired script. Each folder contains a separate Python file for the corresponding algorithm.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <algorithm-folder>
python algorithm_name.py
```
